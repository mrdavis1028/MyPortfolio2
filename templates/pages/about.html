                    <h1>Personal </h1>
                    <p>I do a few other things outside of design. I love art, both going to museums to see it in addition to creating my own. I have been drawing since I was little, and began painting a bit more recently. I even dabble in 3D sculpting, though I am still learning. I also enjoy working out to stay in shape and relieve stress as well as spending time with my family.</p>
